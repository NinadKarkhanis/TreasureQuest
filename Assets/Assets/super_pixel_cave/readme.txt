//HOW TO USE THIS TILESET//
///////////////////////////

Hello, fellow game developer! Thank you for downloading the Super Pixel Cave tileset. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

Tips:

- There are four tileset styles. They each have their own folder in the root directory.

- In each style folder, you will find a folder named PNG. This folder contains all the objects and tiles as descriptively-named PNGs.

- In either style folder, you will also find a folder named spritesheet. This folder contains the spritesheet for that style, and two choices of metadata format for reading the spritesheet. (Pick the format you like!)

- Many of the pieces are set up to align to an 8x8 grid. Remember this when you're putting it together!

- The layer order from front to back is: terrain, midground, bg1, bg2, bg3.

- You can help make sense of the labels using the following guide, which applies to all my tilesets.

File name definitions:
	- "terrain"				Part of the tileset's terrain. The player probably stands on this.
	- "left/right/top/bottom"		The left/right/top/bottom wall or edge of the terrain.
	- "bg1", "bg2", etc.			Background. Higher number indicates further back.
	- "fg1", "fg2", etc.			Foreground. Higher number indicates further forwards.
	- "_A", "_B", "_C", etc.		A suffix with a letter indicates there are multiple variants of this object.
	- "frame0000", "frame0001", etc.	Filenames like this indicate an animation.
	- "2x2", "4x4", etc.			Indicates the size of this object, in tiles.

- Be sure to check out the included example image to see how to put the tileset together.

- Really curious how it was all made? Need some hints for layer ordering? Check out the PSD or the .pyxel file.
